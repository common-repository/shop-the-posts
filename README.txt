== Description ==

Shop The Posts is a plugin created from Codeless that gives you the possibility to attach a product to each WP Post.
So, if you have a small or a large one Blog Website, this plugin can help you to sell or just showcase products in blog posts.
You can attach:

1. An External Product from an affiliate websit
2. Select a WooCommerce Product from your WP site

After the attachment, on each post (in the loop and single posts too) will be added this feature:
1. In the Loop on Home Page or any loop element, will be added a small cart icon, that on mouseover will show the product attached
2. In Single Posts will be added a fixed (sticky) part on the left/bottom of the page that will show the selected product.
